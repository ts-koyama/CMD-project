Also, considering significant figures, the input values (0.03 and 1000 K) might imply two decimal places for the composition, but the temperature is given as a whole number. The result has many decimal places, so rounding to a reasonable number, maybe two decimal places, would make it more readable. However, the exact value from the tool is precise, so perhaps present it as is but format it nicely.

      "Okay, the user is asking about the highest mountain in Japan. Let me think. The tools provided here are for calculating Gibbs energy for Fe-Cr and Fe-C alloys. Those functions require temperature and composition as inputs. But the question is about a geographical feature, not related to materials science. The functions available can't provide information about mountains. So, I can't use any of the provided tools to answer this. I should inform the user that the available tools don't cover that topic and maybe provide the answer directly since I know the highest mountain in Japan is Mount Fuji. But according to the instructions, if the tools can't handle it, I should state that. However, the user might expect the answer even without the tool. Wait, the instructions say to call functions if needed, else respond. Since there's no function for geographical data, I should respond without using any tools. So, the answer is Mount Fuji, but I need to check if the tools can't handle it. Yes, so I'll answer directly.\n",
