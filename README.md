# Simple agent AI - Gibbs energy calculation and phase-field simulation in materials science and engineering
Demo code for an agent AI that calculates Gibbs energy of iron alloys using the CALPHAD method, or performs phase decomposition by the phase-field method.

## Installation

The agent parts are written in Jupyternotebook using the LangGraph library. The  [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) is used as the local LLM environment, and the qwen 3 model is employed as the the language model. Therefore, please install Ollama and Qwen 3 first.

## Run

Executing the code in the Jupyternotebook produces Gibbs energy or phase separation behavior.


## Modification

This is a simple framework for constructing an agent AI system that calculates fundamental programs in materials science and engineering.
You can mofify the sample codes by relaceing the tools part to your original code.
